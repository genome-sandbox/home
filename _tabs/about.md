The project, “Promoting Health Equity through Ethical AI/ML: A Collaborative Initiative for Data Governance and Access in Healthcare,” is to strengthen data governance in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues affecting minority populations. The project is lead by Tuskegee University and UTHealth Houston by the Department of Health Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and is funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) under the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) Data and Infrastructure Capacity Building (DICB) program. This will be achieved through a series of team-building, needs assessment, and planning activities in Phase I of the project. The primary goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive resource center at Tuskegee University (in partnership with UTHealth) that addresses data access and governance requirements while promoting AI/ML capacity building. The initiative aims to promote health equity within the consortium by considering vulnerable populations and social determinants of health.
